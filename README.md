## üöÄ How It Works  

1. The 8051 microcontroller is programmed to send sequential HIGH signals to the output pins connected to the LEDs.  
2. LEDs light up one by one in a pattern, creating the chaser effect.  
3. The timing of the sequence is controlled through delays in the microcontroller code.
